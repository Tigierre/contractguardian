## Opening an issue

Before opening an issue, search existing ones to avoid duplicates.

**Bug report** — include:
- What you did, what you expected, what happened
- Browser / Node.js version
- Relevant error messages or logs

**Feature request** — describe the problem you're trying to solve, not just the solution. If it's a larger idea, open a discussion first so we can align before anyone writes code.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Follow the existing code style (TypeScript strict, ESLint, Prettier)
3. Keep the PR focused — one change per PR
4. Add a clear description of what the PR does and why
5. Test your changes locally before submitting

For anything beyond a small fix, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Notes

- This project is maintained part-time. Reviews may take a few days.
- PRs that add dependencies, change architecture, or touch the AI prompts need more discussion before merging.
- The analysis output is informational only and does not constitute legal advice — keep that in mind when proposing changes to prompts or output formatting.
